## DAY 1 - Introduction to SkyWater130 PDK and basic DRC/LVS Design flow

SkyWater130 is completely open source PDK where design rules, layers definition, device definition rules, simulation models and device models are made open for public. In SkyWater130, 130 stands for 130nm or feature size of transistor. SkyWater130 is divided into three parts of public repository mainly Documentation, PDK libraries and files and Community.

The tools that can work with SkyWater PDK are Magic, Klayout, netgen, xschem, openlane, ngspice
